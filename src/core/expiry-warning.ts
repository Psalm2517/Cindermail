// while it still has at least a day left. Using [0h, 24h] instead would let
// an address expiring 25 hours from now slip past today's run and only get
// warned at tomorrow's, an hour before it goes.

// owner_preferences table, so the very first query throws. A missing table
// silently breaking mail delivery has bitten this project once already.
